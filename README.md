# A dynamic web page is a web page that displays different content each time it's viewed. For example, here we try to make a web page as like adidas.
A dynamic website can contain client-side scripting or server-side scripting to generate the changing content, or a combination of both scripting types. These sites also include HTML programming for the basic structure. The client-side or server-side scripting takes care of the guts of the site.

With client-side HTML scripting, the page can use JavaScript or another scripting language to change the data of page as it is dynamically built.
